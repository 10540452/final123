    """What are coronaviruses, COVID-19 and how are they related to SARS?

    What is a coronavirus?
    Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses which may cause illness in animals or humans.  In humans, several coronaviruses are known to cause respiratory infections ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases such as Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS). The most recently discovered coronavirus causes coronavirus disease COVID-19.

    What is COVID-19?
    COVID-19 is the infectious disease caused by the most recently discovered coronavirus. This new virus and disease were unknown before the outbreak began in Wuhan, China, in December 2019. COVID-19 is now a pandemic affecting many countries globally.

    Is COVID-19 the same as SARS?
    No. The virus that causes COVID-19 and the one that caused the outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) in 2003 are related to each other genetically, but the diseases they cause are quite different. SARS was more deadly but much less infectious than COVID-19. There have been no outbreaks of SARS anywhere in the world since 2003.

    """*What are the symptoms of COVID-19?*

    The most common symptoms of COVID-19 are:
    🤒 fever
    😴 tiredness
    💨 dry cough

    Other symptoms that are less common and may affect some patients include aches and pains, nasal congestion, headache, conjunctivitis, sore throat, diarrhea, loss of taste or smell or a rash on skin or discoloration of fingers or toes.
    These symptoms are usually mild and begin gradually. Some people become infected but don’t develop any symptoms and don't feel unwell.
    Most people (about 80%) recover from the disease without needing special treatment. Around 1 out of every 6 people who gets COVID-19 becomes seriously ill and develops difficulty breathing.
    Older people, and those with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart and lung problems, diabetes, or cancer are at higher risk of developing serious illness. However, anyone can catch COVID-19 and become seriously ill.
    People of all ages who experience fever and/or cough associated with difficulty breathing/shortness of breath, chest pain/pressure, or loss of speech or movement should seek medical attention immediately. If possible, it is recommended to call the health care provider or facility first, so the patient can be directed to the right clinic.

    """How does COVID-19 spread?
    🤧 People can catch COVID-19 from others who have the virus.
    💦 The disease can spread from person to person through small droplets from the nose or mouth which are spread when a person with COVID-19 coughs or exhales.
    🥄 These droplets land on objects and surfaces around the person.
    👈 Other people then catch COVID-19 by touching these objects or surfaces, then touching their eyes, nose or mouth.
    ↔️ People can also catch COVID-19 if they breathe in droplets from a person with COVID-19 who coughs out or exhales droplets. This is why it is important to stay more than 1 meter (3 feet) away from a person who is sick.
    WHO is assessing ongoing research on the ways COVID-19 is spread and will continue to share updated findings.

    Can the virus that causes COVID-19 be transmitted through the air?
    Studies to date suggest that the virus that causes COVID-19 is mainly transmitted through contact with respiratory droplets rather than through the air.

    Can COVID-19 be caught from a person who has no symptoms?
    The main way the disease spreads is through respiratory droplets expelled by someone who is coughing. The risk of catching COVID-19 from someone with no symptoms at all is very low. However, many people with COVID-19 experience only mild symptoms. This is particularly true at the early stages of the disease. It is therefore possible to catch COVID-19 from someone who has, for example, just a mild cough and does not feel ill.

    WHO is assessing ongoing research on the period of transmission of COVID-19 and will continue to share updated findings.

    """Can I catch COVID-19 from surfaces or packages?

    🥄 How long does the virus survive on surfaces?
    It is not certain how long the virus that causes COVID-19 survives on surfaces, but it seems to behave like other coronaviruses. Studies suggest that coronaviruses (including preliminary information on the COVID-19 virus) may persist on surfaces for a few hours or up to several days. This may vary under different conditions (e.g. type of surface, temperature or humidity of the environment).
    If you think a surface may be infected, clean it with simple disinfectant to kill the virus and protect yourself and others. Clean your hands with an alcohol-based hand rub or wash them with soap and water. Avoid touching your eyes, mouth, or nose.
    
    📦 Is it safe to receive a package from any area where COVID-19 has been reported?
    Yes. The likelihood of an infected person contaminating commercial goods is low and the risk of catching the virus that causes COVID-19 from a package that has been moved, travelled, and exposed to different conditions and temperature is also low.

    """What can I do to protect myself and prevent the spread of disease?

    Protection measures for everyone:
    
    ℹ️ Stay aware of the latest information on the COVID-19 outbreak, available on the WHO website and through your national and local public health authority. Many countries around the world have seen cases of COVID-19 and several have seen outbreaks. Authorities in China and some other countries have succeeded in slowing or stopping their outbreaks. However, the situation is unpredictable so check regularly for the latest news.
    You can reduce your chances of being infected or spreading COVID-19 by taking some simple precautions:
    
    🧼 Regularly and thoroughly clean your hands with an alcohol-based hand rub or wash them with soap and water.
    Why? Washing your hands with soap and water or using alcohol-based hand rub kills viruses that may be on your hands.
    
    ↔️ Maintain at least 1 metre (3 feet) distance between yourself and anyone who is coughing or sneezing.
    Why?  When someone coughs or sneezes they spray small liquid droplets from their nose or mouth which may contain virus. If you are too close, you can breathe in the droplets, including the COVID-19 virus if the person coughing has the disease.
    
    🚫 Avoid touching eyes, nose and mouth
    Why? Hands touch many surfaces and can pick up viruses. Once contaminated, hands can transfer the virus to your eyes, nose or mouth. From there, the virus can enter your body and can make you sick.

    🤧 Make sure you, and the people around you, follow good respiratory hygiene. This means covering your mouth and nose with your bent elbow or tissue when you cough or sneeze. Then dispose of the used tissue immediately.
    Why? Droplets spread virus. By following good respiratory hygiene you protect the people around you from viruses such as cold, flu and COVID-19.

    🏠 Stay home if you feel unwell. If you have a fever, cough and difficulty breathing, seek medical attention and call in advance. Follow the directions of your local health authority.
    Why? National and local authorities will have the most up to date information on the situation in your area. Calling in advance will allow your health care provider to quickly direct you to the right health facility. This will also protect you and help prevent spread of viruses and other infections.

    🧳 Keep up to date on the latest COVID-19 hotspots (cities or local areas where COVID-19 is spreading widely). If possible, avoid traveling to places  – especially if you are an older person or have diabetes, heart or lung disease.
    Why? You have a higher chance of catching COVID-19 in one of these areas.

    If you have recently visited (past 14 days) areas where COVID-19 is spreading follow the guidance outlined in question 15. (What can I do to protect myself and prevent the spread of disease?) and do the following:

    🏠 Self-isolate by staying at home if you begin to feel unwell, even with mild symptoms such as headache, low grade fever (37.3°C or above) and slight runny nose, until you recover.
    If it is essential for you to have someone bring you supplies or to go out, e.g. to buy food, then wear a mask to avoid infecting other people.

    Why?
    Avoiding contact with others and visits to medical facilities will allow these facilities to operate more effectively and help protect you and others from possible COVID-19 and other viruses.
    🤒 If you develop fever, cough and difficulty breathing, seek medical advice promptly as this may be due to a respiratory infection or other serious condition. Call in advance and tell your provider of any recent travel or contact with travelers.

    """What are the treatment options for COVID-19 (including drugs, vaccines, therapies)?

    💊 Are antibiotics effective in preventing or treating COVID-19?
    No. Antibiotics do not work against viruses, they only work on bacterial infections. COVID-19 is caused by a virus, so antibiotics do not work. Antibiotics should not be used as a means of prevention or treatment of COVID-19. They should only be used as directed by a physician to treat a bacterial infection.

    🧪 Are there any medicines or therapies that can prevent or cure COVID-19?
    While some western, traditional or home remedies may provide comfort and alleviate symptoms of mild COVID-19, there are no medicines that have been shown to prevent or cure the disease. WHO does not recommend self-medication with any medicines, including antibiotics, as a prevention or cure for COVID-19.

    💉 Is there a vaccine, drug or treatment for COVID-19?
    Not yet. To date, there is no vaccine and no specific antiviral medicine to prevent or treat COVID-2019. However, those affected should receive care to relieve symptoms. People with serious illness should be hospitalized. Most patients recover thanks to supportive care.
    Possible vaccines and some specific drug treatments are under investigation. They are being tested through clinical trials. WHO is coordinating efforts to develop vaccines and medicines to prevent and treat COVID-19.
    The most effective ways to protect yourself and others against COVID-19 are to frequently clean your hands, cover your cough with the bend of elbow or tissue, and maintain a distance of at least 1 meter (3 feet) from people who are coughing or sneezing.

    """Questions relating to food consumers

    Can I get COVID-19 from food?
    There is currently no evidence that people can catch COVID-19 from food or food packaging. COVID-19 is a respiratory illness and the transmission route is through person-to-person contact and through direct contact with respiratory droplets generated when an infected person coughs or sneezes.

    Can the virus live on the surface of foods (including fruits and vegetables, frozen foods, pre-packaged foods)?
    Coronaviruses cannot multiply in food – they need a live animal or human host to multiply and survive .

    How to wash fruits and vegetables? Just with water, or something else?
    Washing fruit and vegetables with potable water is sufficient: it is recommended to follow the WHO 5-Keys to Safer Food (bit.ly/2Nn4NuB).

    Can the virus live on the surface of food packaging? How long? Is it necessary to disinfect?
    It is not necessary to disinfect food packaging materials, but hands should be properly washed after handling food packages and before eating.

    How long is it to cook food? To what temperature to kill the virus?
    This virus is not more resistant to heat than the usual viruses and bacteria found in food. As recommended for good hygiene practice, foods should be thoroughly cooked to at least 70°C.

    What precautions should consumers take in grocery stores?
    Consumers should maintain a safe physical distance of at least one metre from all other shoppers and staff while queuing before entering the store and while shopping in the store. If a trolley or basket is used while shopping, sanitize the handle before and after use. Hands should be sanitized before entering the store. Practice good coughing/sneezing etiquette while in the store. Avoid touching mouth, nose or eyes during shopping. Minimise direct hand contact with food by using available tongs and serving utensils. Use contactless payment rather than cash/notes (where feasible).

    Is food/grocery delivery safe?
    Yes, if the provider follows good personal and food hygiene practices. After accepting food/grocery deliveries, hands should be washed with soap and water.

    What is the best household disinfectant for surfaces?
    Regular household cleaning and disinfection products will effectively eliminate the virus from household surfaces.  For cleaning and disinfecting households with suspected or confirmed COVID19 illnesses - surface virucidal disinfectants, such as 0.05% sodium hypochlorite (NaClO) and products based on ethanol (at least 70%), should be used.

    Is it still safe to go to food markets? Animal markets? Wet markets?
    It should be safe provided it is possible to maintain a safe physical distance of at least one metre from all other shoppers and staff, it is possible to wash/sanitize hands, and that Good Manufacturing Practices and Good Hygienic Practices (GMP/GHP) standards are maintained in the market. For more recommendations on how to minimise the risk of transmission of emerging pathogens in wet markets, see the WHO recommendations to reduce risk of transmission of emerging pathogens from animals to humans in live animal markets or animal product markets (bit.ly/2Bycs6M).

    """Tuberculosis and COVID-19

    WHO is continuously monitoring and responding to tuberculosis (TB) prevention and care during the COVID-19 pandemic. Health services need to be actively engaged for an effective and rapid response to COVID-19 while ensuring that TB and other essential health services are maintained.

    Are people with tuberculosis likely to be at increased risk of COVID-19 infection, illness and death?
    While experience on COVID-19 infection in tuberculosis (TB) patients remains limited, it is anticipated that people ill with both TB and COVID-19 may have poorer treatment outcomes, especially if TB treatment is interrupted.
    Older age, diabetes and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are linked with more severe COVID-19 and are also risk factors for poor outcomes in TB.
    TB patients should take precautions as advised by health authorities to be protected from COVID-19 and continue their TB treatment as prescribed.
    People ill with COVID-19 and TB show similar symptoms such as cough, fever and difficulty breathing. Both diseases attack primarily the lungs and although both biological agents transmit mainly via close contact, the incubation period from exposure to disease in TB is longer, often with a slow onset.

    Self-care interventions recommended by WHO are evidence-based and can include information about a sexual or reproductive health issue as well as ways in which individuals can obtain drugs, devices, diagnostics and/or digital products fully or partially separate from formal health services that can be used with or without the direct supervision of a health worker. For example, self-injectable contraception, HPV self-sampling kits or HIV self-tests.

    Why are self-care interventions important during a pandemic like COVID-19?
    With the major disruptions to the normal functioning of national health systems caused by the need to respond to people who have or are affected by the virus, evidence-based, high-quality self-care interventions can provide an important alternative to the usual health facility- or health worker-based services. Self-care is a valuable part of a well-functioning health system and can be particularly useful when physical distancing measures make it more difficult for people to access their normal health care services and medications.

    What self care actions can I take to protect my sexual and reproductive health?
    In 2019, WHO issued a new guideline that brought together 32 existing or new recommendations on a range of sexual and reproductive health self-care interventions. The guideline has recommendations on pregnancy and newborn care, contraception, abortion, sexually transmitted infections including HIV and HPV, and for sexual health more broadly.

    """What is dexamethasone and does it work against COVID-19?

    Dexamethasone is a corticosteroid used in a wide range of conditions for its anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressant effects.
    It was tested in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 in the United Kingdom’s national clinical trial RECOVERY and was found to have benefits for critically ill patients.
    According to preliminary findings shared with WHO (and now available as a preprint), for patients on ventilators, the treatment was shown to reduce mortality by about one third, and for patients requiring only oxygen, mortality was cut by about one fifth.
